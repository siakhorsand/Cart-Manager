# Cart-Manager
**Cart-Manager** is a Python-based shopping cart management application. The program allows users to view a list of available products, each with its name, price, and discount percentage. Users can interactively add or remove products from their cart, view the cart's contents, and see the total price after discounts. The application is structured around three main classes.

*Data for the products is sourced from a CSV file, and the application provides a user-friendly command menu for interaction.*
